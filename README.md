## What is this?

This repository contains the public FTC SDK for the Freight Frenzy (2021-2022) competition season modified by First Tech Challange Under Construction RO092 (19063) team.
The main idea of the code is to recreate Road Runner, but in a mutch easier way.

If you wanna use it, watch the TODOs in the project.
